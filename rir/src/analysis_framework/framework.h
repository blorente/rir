  Dispatchers are used to determine the current situation and execute the
  appropriate code. Each dispatcher must override the doDispatch() method. If
  the dispatch fails, the dispatcher is supposed to call the fail() method, so
  that the dispatch() can return proper result.

  Note that failing the dispatch does not necessarily mean an error, it merely
  signifies that the dispatcher did not recognize the situation, or that the
  code dispatched to wanted to override the failure.
